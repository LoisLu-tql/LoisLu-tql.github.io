Heeeello my university🙋🏻‍♀️!

The cover is the first photo I took in my university. I come from a small city in the west of Hunan province, it is not easy for me to get in there🥲, as Hunan used the hardest exam paper and had 300, 000 examinees (I got the 1600th place🥳). My major is computer science, while I only used computer for games before🤣. I even asked a senior schoolfellow "Will I usually use puctuations when programming?"
